Like Travel Man, But With Data.   The Data is Here, But Should We Have Ingested it?



The last few years, travel has been tough with diseases, air quality problems, fires, airline delays, wars and other events. The only way to know is to measure the conditions and make that decision. So using Open Source sofware including NiFi, MiNiFi, Iceberg, Kafka and Flink I will do just that.

There are so many streams of data to look at to determine if it's worth the trip from flights, delays, the weather, air quality, local sensors, travel advisories, reviews, social media, local transit and more.

So I looked at everything and determined yes NDC {London} is worth the trip from sunny New Jersey. And I'll show you how to make those decisions too.
